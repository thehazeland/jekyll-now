Before think anything, let’s talk about coding. A simple but crucial question, what is coding?
After researching, learning or even code something, it turns out that coding is just a method human use to talk with machine, or in other words, tell them do something we don’t want or can't do because there’re some jobs suit for machine, but not suit for us.

So the tao of coding means the right way, the good way to do coding. But why do we need it?
Because making code works or getting job done is not enough. Martin Fowler said: “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand”. It’s not about business of human and machine anymore, it’s about human and human.

If we want to clarify something, view it in business perspective. All product owners care about productivity, cost and time. Unless you work alone, the effort of the other members or people who use your code should be counted. You always want to do something people can reuse, take care for you in the case you’re not there and of course you can review and use in the future. Yes, that is development. Everything you’ve heard: design patterns, frameworks, software architecture, … were born for that reason. So keep in mind, it's not personal it's just business.

There’re some kind of paths you can step from here, take one and it will lead you, "All roads lead to Rome”. Learn more but follow your target, improve your coding skills everyday, that makes different, remember “Rome wasn't built in a day”.
